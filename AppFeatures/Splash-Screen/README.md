## [SPLASH SCREEN](SplashScreen/SplashScreen/Views/SplashScreenView.swift)
- A splash screen is the first graphical notification you receive when you visit any app. 
  - It can even appear as an introductory screen of an application. 
- It also signifies that you have to wait for a few seconds before landing on the actual screen of the application.
- A splash screen usually appears in full screen that covers the entire screen.  
- Every good app uses a splash screen that gives them a unique identity.
- Splash screen, in a nutshell, is the first impression creator.
